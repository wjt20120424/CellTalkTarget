\arguments{
\item{object}{CellTalkTarget object after \code{\link{find_CellTalkTarget}}}

\item{condition}{which conditions to plot. Default is plot all conditions.}

\item{celltype}{which cell types to plot by order. Default is to plot all cell types.}

\item{celltype_color}{Colors for the cell types, whose length must be equal to \code{celltype}}

\item{miRNA}{which miRNAs to use. Default is to plot all inferred miRNAs in senders.}

\item{edge_color}{Colors for the edges from the sender cell type, whose length must be equal to \code{celltype}}

\item{edge_type}{Types for the edges from the sender cell type. Default is \code{"big.arrow"}. \code{"ellipse"} for ellipse, "triangle" for triangle, "curved" for curved. Details see \code{\link[circlize]{chordDiagram}}}

\item{show_type}{which type of miRNAs to show, \code{"number"}, \code{"EVmiR_score"}, or \code{"score"} for sum of inferred miRNAs number, EVmiR_score, and MiTI_score, respectively. Default is \code{"number"}}

\item{if_show_autocrine}{Whether to show autocrine. Default is \code{FALSE}}

\item{text_size}{Size of text labels. Default is \code{1.5}}

\item{y_scale}{y_scale to adjust the text. Default is \code{0.1}}

\item{...}{parameters pass to \code{\link[circlize]{chordDiagram}}, e.g., link.arr.width, link.arr.length, link.arr.col}
